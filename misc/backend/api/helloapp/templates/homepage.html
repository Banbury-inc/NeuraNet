    <h3>February 3, 2024 - Banbury Cloud Beta CLI 1.0.1 Released</h3>
    <p>Recently, we have made a slight change in what we have been doing in terms of the file sharing. Initially, 
      we had an idea that IPFS would really be the backbone of the decentralized file sharing. We came across 
      a lot of complications, especially when it came to port forwarding. In other words, it was really easy 
      to upload files from IPFS and download them again, but only within your own network. Ultimately, we decided
      to drop the idea of IPFS, for now. Instead, we have decided to implement something called a relay server.
      In other words, this provides a way for us to access files on another device, even if that device is on another
      network. This is a really exciting new direction for us. </p>
    <p>In recent developments, we have been working on a desktop application that would be running all of the logic
      necessary in order to bring the device online. This can't really happen with a web app, and we apps are not able
      to access things like the files on your computer, especially in the way that we want. Our next announcement
      will hopefully be the release of the desktop app. We are also working hard to make the desktop app open source.</p>
    <h3>February 3, 2024 - Banbury Cloud Beta CLI Tool Released</h3>
    <p>There are some exciting new advancements in the realm of Banbury! We have recently released 
    the very first Beta version of bcloud. bcloud is a CLI tool for Banbury Cloud. This acts as a 
    prototype for what will eventually be Banbury Cloud.</p>
