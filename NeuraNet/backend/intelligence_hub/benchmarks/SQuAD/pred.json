It is situated in the northern part of the country, bordering the English Channel to the north and the regions of Centre-Val de Loire and \u00cele-de-France to the south and east respectively.", "56ddde6b9a695914005b9629": "The Normans, a group of Vikings who settled in northern France, arrived in Normandy around the 9th century. The exact date of their arrival is not well-documented, but it is believed to have occurred sometime between 820 and 911.\n\nThe first recorded Viking raid on the Frankish kingdom took place in 799, when a group of Vikings attacked the monastery of Saint-Bertin at Sithiu (modern-day St-Bertin-sur-Mer). This event marked the beginning of Viking raids and settlements in Normandy.\n\nOver the next few decades, more Viking settlers arrived in Normandy, attracted by its fertile land, rich resources, and strategic location. They established themselves primarily in the region around the Seine River, which became known as Normandy.\n\nThe Viking leader Rollo, also known as Ganger Rolf, is believed to have led a group of Vikings who settled in Normandy in the late 9th century. According to the Carmen de Hastingae, a Latin chronicle written by Guy of Amiens around 1070, Rollo arrived in Normandy in 911 and was granted control over the region by the Frankish king Charles the Simple.\n\nRollo's settlement marked the beginning of Norman rule in Normandy, which would last for centuries. Over time, the Vikings assimilated with the local population, adopting Christianity and French culture, while maintaining their Viking heritage and martial traditions. The resulting fusion of cultures gave rise to the Norman people, who went on to play a significant role in European history during the Middle Ages.", "56ddde6b9a695914005b962a": "The Norse people, also known as the Vikings, originated from Scandinavia, specifically from present-day Denmark, Norway, and Sweden. The Viking Age, which lasted from the 8th to the 11th centuries, saw these seafaring warriors and traders travel extensively throughout Europe, leaving a lasting impact on the cultures they encountered.\n\nThe Norse people were divided into several tribes or kingdoms, including:\n\n1. Danes (from present-day Denmark)\n2. Norwegians (from present-day Norway)\n3. Swedes (from present-day Sweden)\n4. Gotlanders (from the island of Gotland in present-day Sweden)\n5. Jomsvikings (a loose confederation of Viking warriors and traders)\n\nThe Norse people were known for their seafaring skills, craftsmanship, and bravery, as well as their mythological tales and legends, which have been passed down through the centuries and continue to fascinate us today.\n\nIt's worth noting that the concept of a single \"Norse\" ethnicity is somewhat of an anachronism, as the Viking Age saw significant cultural exchange and migration between these Scandinavian tribes. Nevertheless, the term \"Norse\" has become a useful shorthand for referring to the cultures and traditions of this period in Scandinavian history."}
