AI Agents to Implement:

Task Management Agent:
- Queue system. Parse the list and make them individual objects that are placed in some type 
of list. 

Vision Agent:
- Detects objects in the environment and sends them as messages to other agents (e.g., a robot)
- captures image of the environment and generates description in words of what the environment
is like
- 
Health Agent:
- Monitors CPU, GPU, Memory and determines if the computer is in a good state. Sends messages to
task management agent if something needs to be turned off.

Motor Control Agent:
- Makes movements of motors, returns motor positions.

Navigation Agent:
- Able to take in cordinates, return coordinates
